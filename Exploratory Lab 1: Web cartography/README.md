The Whale Trail is a non-profit whose mission is to inspire appreciation and stewardship of orcas, other marine mammals and the marine environment by identifying a network of viewing sites along the whalesâ€™ trails through the Salish Sea and along the Pacific Coast.

I kept this map to points noted on the whale trail within Washington State. The organization has a map of notable places on their website https://thewhaletrail.org/regions/washington/ however the points on the map are all the same and do not provide the viewer with information beyond the name of a given denoted point.


On this map, every point is given a symbol that references what it represents. While the whale trail claims that they identify a network of viewing sights, the points on their map denote cities, aquariums, and museums which could be confused as viewing points. The goal of this map is to communicate each point more effectively through its symbology, which I believe was achieved. 
	
I chose to highlight the major roadways as I deem them extremely important in effective land base whale observation; furthermore, the highlighted roads provide the viewer with a faster understanding of the accessibility of each point on the map. The zoom feature was used for the road layer, as well as the points. The major roads become brighter the more the zoom is increased, and the symbols decrease by a small degree when zoomed in. The largest improvement that could be made is the visibility of all of the points on the map. Currently, if two or more symbols are close together, when zoomed out only one is shown to the viewer, to their detriment as this may mean some points may be lost.
